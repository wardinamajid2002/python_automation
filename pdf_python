'6 The Crucible \n \nand they had to be to survive the life they  had chosen or been born into in this \ncountry. \nThe proof of their belief’s value to them may be taken from the opposite \ncharacter of the first Jamestown settlement, farther south, in Virginia. The \nEnglishmen who landed there were motivated mainly by a hunt for profit. They \nhad thought to pick off the wealth of the new country and then return rich to \nEng-land.
